            Why Sipsip?
            <br />
            Sipsip is a beautiful tagalog word that means to impress. 
            We surmise that most non-cooks or normies usually only start cooking when they want to impress someone. 
            <br /><br />
            What is Sipsip?
            <br />
            As a non-cook who grew up surrounded by cooks. I wanted to make something that makes cooking less daunting to my fellow non-cooks .
